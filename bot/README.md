# Werewolf Discord Bot

A Discord bot for managing Werewolf (mafia) games across multiple servers.

## Features

- Game management (signup, voting, day/night cycles)
- Role management and assignments
- Journal system for players
- Archive functionality for game categories
- **Daily member sync for archive purposes**

## Daily Member Sync

The bot includes an automated daily process that syncs all server members to the database for archive purposes. This feature:

- **Runs automatically** every day at 2 AM UTC
- **Stores member data** in the `server_users` table with:
  - `user_id`: Discord user ID
  - `server_id`: Discord server ID  
  - `display_name`: User's display name (nickname or username)
- **Updates existing records** when display names change
- **Skips bot users** to avoid cluttering the database
- **Provides logging** to a designated channel (if configured)

### Manual Sync Command

Moderators can trigger a manual sync using:
```
Wolf.sync_members
```

### Configuration

To enable logging to a Discord channel, set the environment variable:
```
MEMBER_SYNC_LOG_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id_here
```

### Database Schema

The member data is stored in the `server_users` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE server_users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    server_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    display_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

### Discord Bot Setup

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a new application
3. Go to "Bot" section and create a bot
4. Copy the bot token to your `.env` file
5. Enable the following intents:
   - MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT
   - SERVER MEMBERS INTENT
6. Go to "Installation" tab 
7. Ensure that "bot" is added under "Guild Install" > "Scopes"
8. Ensure the following Permissions are granted under "Guild Install" > "Permissions"
   - Add Reactions
   - Embed Links
   - Manage Channels
   - Manage Messages (*needed for creating Mod role with this permission*)
   - Manage Roles
   - Pin Messages (*newish alternative role for allowing just Pin without broader Manage access*)
   - Read Message History

   - View Channels
9. Open the "Install Link" in your browser, select the Server where you want to add the bot, Authorize all
10. With bot running, use command `wolf.server_roles`
11. Grant bot user the "Mod" role

### S3 Bucket Setup (for Image Processing)

If you want to enable automatic Discord image processing during archiving:

1. Create an S3 bucket named `stinkwolf-images` in your AWS account
2. Configure the bucket for public read access by adding a bucket policy:
   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": "*",
               "Action": "s3:GetObject",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::stinkwolf-images/*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
3. Set up an IAM user with the following permissions:
   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "s3:PutObject"
               ],
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::stinkwolf-images/*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
4. Add the IAM user credentials to your `.env` file
5. Test the setup with: `npm run test-images`

**Image Storage**: Images are stored using the message ID as the filename (e.g., `message_id.jpg`) to prevent duplicates when re-archiving categories. For messages with multiple images, additional images use `_1`, `_2`, etc. suffixes.

## 🎯 Typical Game Flow

1. **Server Setup** (one-time):
   ```
   Wolf.setup
   # Follow prompts to set prefix, starting number, and game name
   
   Wolf.server_roles
   # Creates all necessary game roles
   ```

2. **Create Game**:
   ```
   Wolf.create
   # Creates signup channel and category
   ```

3. **Player Signups**:
   ```
   Wolf.in   # Players join
   Wolf.out  # Players leave (if needed)
   ```

4. **Start Game**:
   ```
   Wolf.start
   # Creates all game channels, renames signup to dead-chat
   ```

5. **During Game**:
   ```
   Wolf.vote @player    # Players vote (day phase only)
   Wolf.retract         # Players retract votes

   ```

6. **End Game**:
   ```
   Wolf.end
   # Requires confirmation
   ```

## 📔 Journal System

The bot includes a comprehensive journal system for players to take notes and communicate with moderators.

### Journal Features

- **Personal journals**: Each player gets their own private channel
- **Automatic creation**: Journals are created when players sign up or manually with `Wolf.journal @user`
- **Permission management**: Players can read/write, moderators can read/write, spectators can read only
- **Database tracking**: All journals are tracked in the database for persistence

### Journal Balancing

Discord has a 50-channel limit per category. The system automatically handles this by:

- **Proactively preventing Discord limits** by splitting at 49+ journals before creating new ones
- **User-friendly notifications** when splits are about to occur
- **Automatically placing** new journals in the appropriate category based on alphabetical order
- **Automatically rebalancing** categories when needed to maintain equal distribution
- **Automatically splitting** journals into multiple categories when approaching the 50-journal limit
- **Creating smart category names** like "Journals (A-L)" and "Journals (M-Z)"
- **Preserving all permissions** when moving channels
- **Automatic alphabetical ordering** - categories are created in the correct order from the start

You can also manually rebalance using `Wolf.balance_journals` if needed.

**Scenarios**:
- **< 50 journals**: Stays in single category, just alphabetized
- **50+ journals**: Splits into multiple categories to stay well under the Discord limit
  - **50 journals**: Splits into 2 categories of 25 each
  - **75 journals**: Splits into 2 categories of 38 each
  - **100 journals**: Splits into 2 categories of 50 each
  - **120+ journals**: Splits into 3+ categories as needed

**Testing**: Use `Wolf.populate_journals [number]` to create test journals for testing the balancing system.

For detailed documentation, see [Journal Balancing System](docs/journal-balancing.md).

## 🎭 Role System

The bot uses a comprehensive role system to manage permissions and access:

### Roles

| Role | Color | Purpose | Permissions |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Mod** | 🔴 Red | Moderators/Admins | Can see mod-chat, manage channels |
| **Spectator** | ⚪ Gray | Default for new members | Can see and chat in dead-chat only |
| **Signed Up** | 🟡 Yellow | Players who joined the game | Temporary role during signup phase |
| **Alive** | 🟢 Green | Living players | Can see all game channels, cannot see dead-chat |
| **Dead** | ⚫ Black | Eliminated players | Can see all channels, can only chat in dead-chat |

### Role Flow

1. **Setup**: Run `Wolf.roles` to create all roles
2. **Signup**: Players who use `Wolf.in` get **Signed Up** role
3. **Game Start**: All **Signed Up** players become **Alive**
4. **Elimination**: Players manually change from **Alive** to **Dead** (by moderators)
5. **Spectators**: Non-players get **Spectator** role for watching

### Channel Permissions

- **Dead Chat**: Dead + Spectators can see/chat, Alive cannot see
- **Game Channels**: Alive can see/chat, Dead can see but not chat, Spectators cannot see
- **Mod Chat**: Only Mod role can see and chat

## 📁 Channel Structure

When a game is created, the bot generates:

### During Signup Phase
- `{prefix}{number}-signups` - Player signup channel

### During Active Game
- `{prefix}{number}-dead-chat` - Chat for eliminated players (displays **initial player list** when game starts)
- `{prefix}{number}-townsquare` - Main game discussion
- `{prefix}{number}-wolf-chat` - Private wolf communication
- `{prefix}{number}-memos` - Game notes and information
- `{prefix}{number}-results` - Game results and announcements
- `{prefix}{number}-voting-booth` - Voting channel
- `{prefix}{number}-breakdown` - Roles available in the game
- `{prefix}{number}-mod-chat` - Private moderator communication

Example with prefix "g" and game number 1:
- `g1-signups` → `g1-dead-chat`
- `g1-town-square`
- `g1-wolf-chat`
- etc.

## 🗳️ Voting System

The voting system provides real-time vote tracking with several built-in protections:

- Players can only vote during day phases
- Votes must be cast in the voting booth channel
- **Players cannot vote for themselves** (self-voting is blocked)
- Vote counts are updated in real-time with **display names** for clarity
- Players can retract and change votes
- Voting results show both vote counts and who voted for whom
- Votes are cleared each new day

Example vote display:
```
Player1 (2)
- Player2
- Player3

Player2 (1)
- Player1
```

## 🗄️ Archive System

The archive system allows moderators to save all messages from a game category to a JSON file for permanent storage.

### Archive Command

**Usage:** `Wolf.archive <category-name>`

The archive command will:
1. Find the specified category by name (case-insensitive)
2. Process all text channels in the category (excluding mod-chat channels)
3. Fetch all messages from each channel with complete metadata
4. Generate a timestamped JSON file with all data
5. Upload to S3 (if configured) and/or save locally

### Archive Data Structure

The generated JSON file includes:
- **Category metadata**: name, ID, archive timestamp, archived by user
- **Channel data**: For each channel, includes all messages with:
  - Message content, author, timestamps
  - User display names and usernames
  - Reply references and attachments
  - Embeds and reactions
  - Complete message threading information

### S3 Integration (Optional)

If AWS S3 is configured, archive files are automatically uploaded to your S3 bucket:

**Required Environment Variables:**
```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key_here  
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name-here
```

**S3 Storage Structure:**
- Files are uploaded to: `archives/<category-name>_<category-id>.json`
- Files overwrite previous backups to prevent duplicates
- Public URLs are provided in the completion message
- Local backup is always created regardless of S3 configuration

### Archive Features

- **Complete message history**: All messages from category channels
- **Rich metadata**: User info, timestamps, attachments, reactions
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in delays to respect Discord API limits
- **Error handling**: Continues processing even if individual channels fail
- **Progress updates**: Real-time status messages during processing
- **Dual storage**: OpenSearch indexing + S3 backup for redundancy
- **Consistent backups**: S3 files use `<category-name>_<category-id>.json` format to prevent duplicates

### Testing

Run the test suite to verify your setup:
```bash
npm test
```

The test suite checks:
- Database connectivity
- Database schema integrity
- Discord bot connection

### Available NPM Scripts

```bash
npm start        # Start the bot in production mode
npm run dev      # Start with auto-restart (development)
npm test         # Run the test suite
npm run db:refresh  # Refresh database schema (⚠️ deletes all data!)
npm run setup-opensearch  # Set up OpenSearch index
npm run test-opensearch   # Test OpenSearch connection
npm run migrate-archives  # Migrate S3 archive files to OpenSearch
```

### Database Management

**Refresh Database Schema:**
```bash
npm run db:refresh
```
⚠️ **Warning**: This completely wipes and recreates all database tables. All game data will be lost!

**Manual Database Setup:**
```bash
psql -h $PG_HOST -p $PG_PORT -U $PG_USER -d $PG_DATABASE -f database_setup.sql
```
- Environment configuration

### Database Schema

The bot uses 4 main tables:
- `server_configs` - Server-specific settings
- `games` - Game instances and metadata
- `players` - Player signups and status
- `votes` - Voting records

## ✨ New Features & Improvements

### Role-Based Permission System
- **`Wolf.roles` command** creates comprehensive role system for game management
- **Automatic role assignment**: Players get appropriate roles during signup and game phases
- **Channel permissions**: Each role has specific access to game channels
- **Roles include**: Mod (admin), Spectator (observers), Signed Up, Alive, Dead
- **Mod-chat channel**: Private communication for moderators in each game

### Display Names
- **Player lists and voting** now show Discord display names instead of usernames for better readability
- Display names are used in signup lists, voting sheets, and player rosters
- System falls back to username if display name is not available

### Anti-Self-Voting
- **Players cannot vote for themselves** - the bot will reject self-votes with a clear error message
- Helps prevent accidental votes and maintains game integrity

### Enhanced Game Start
- **Player list is automatically posted** to the dead chat channel when a game starts
- Provides a reference for all participants at the beginning of the game

### Server Refresh for Testing
- **`Wolf.refresh` command** resets a server for quick iteration
- Deletes all text channels except #general, removes all categories, and cleans database
- **Resets all members to Spectator role** (except bots)
- Requires confirmation to prevent accidental use
- Perfect for testing and development environments

### Database Management
- **Complete database refresh script** - `npm run db:refresh` completely wipes and recreates schema
- Useful for development and testing environments
- ⚠️ **Destroys all existing data** - use with caution!

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot not responding:**
